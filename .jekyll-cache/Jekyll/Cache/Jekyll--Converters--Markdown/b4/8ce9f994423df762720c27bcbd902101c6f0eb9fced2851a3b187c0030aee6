<ul>
  <li>Authorship is a function of intellectual contribution and we try to minimize
author bloat in our group. For multi-institution student collaborations, we will
identify ahead of time who the primary advisers and collaborators are on a
project.</li>
  <li>Our work is open. However, there have been prior situations where we have
applied for patents during collaborations.</li>
  <li>We tend to share any data we collect and any code we produce under open
licenses (data: PDDL, code: Apache 2.0, doc: CC-BY)</li>
  <li>Any digital research work we produce together should be re-executable and hopefully
reproducible/generalizable.</li>
</ul>
